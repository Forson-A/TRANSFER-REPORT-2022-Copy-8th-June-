\section{Gantt Chart and Indication of Future Work}
 
 
We have had some MRT facility closures in the last six months due to the new coronavirus at the observatory, as well as cyclone weather circumstances that have impacted the scheduled project plans. Delays in filing Purchasing Requests (PR) for components and materials, as well as follow-ups on them, are another key setback to the project's progress, making it impossible to meet the Gantt Chat time lines.
  
Future work will include research into the design, optimisation, and analysis of array configuration and commissioning to ensure that the telescopes meet the required scientific goals.

If all components and cables ordered arrive on time, the array is expected to be completed and operational for research purposes by September 2022.
